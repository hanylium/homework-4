Terrible show you want so badly to be good. The writing is so lazy and cheap. Cliffhanger tactics to keep people watching.
One of the best Animes out there. Must Watch!!!
Atmosphere and vibes extremely creepy, unique too.
There really is nothing quite like Attack on Titan. I literally held my breath through some parts, and I was openly crying during others. It's a tv show and also an experience.
PEAK ANIME! absolutely incredible story telling!
My first anime also turned out to be my best anime. Where do I even start here? It's almost flawless, only criticism I have is the ending. But everything else... plot, characters, production, everything... Wow. 10/10
"It's long, like unnecessary long. Once it got attention and recognition, they squeezed ""Attack on Titan"" brand to get as many viewers as they can and then they named season 4 ""the final season"" for the same reason but guess what, it's not the final season. Sorry but I don't need another walking dead loophole."
I only saw the first season. Too much useless and not so smart dialogues. It would have been better with half the episodes. Everything else is good though.
It didn’t hold my interest. I will read the wiki.
Goddamn I wish it would just be over already.
The greatest of all time.
Incredible show but plot armour and the poor ending bring it down from a 10/10
watching this masterpiece is great experience
STRESSFUL, but had to put on my recommend list. I don’t think I’ve ever watched a TV show that captured me from the first episode like this one. I thought that all the seasons continued to be super strong. BUT the only thing is that it is super intense and there is like no breaks. So it was hard to sit there and be stressed for a long time. It was worth it though.
The first 3 seasons are great but the 4th isn't that good, especially the art.
I've tried twice to watch it and actually menage to end first season. everyone is so enthusiastic about it , but I don't get the reason why. I've read some of your comments and I've not seen an easy answer about this. it would help to hear some easy answers about it.
Now I see why Drama is put before Action in the genres! It's a great Action anime, but not meaningless fights and beatings, There is quite the story for it! Amazing anime!
One of the things I dislike the most about anime is the unnecessary use of sexual imagery. This show lacks that completely. It takes itself very seriously and I absolutely love that. It's an amazing series with tons of action. Expect to feel on edge from the very beginning to the last minute of it. I can't wait for season 2
Great atmosphere and intriguing story - but its sooo fucking anoying that every episode contains of 50% inner monologue. Show, don’t tell.
So, having now watched it I would have to agree with the general consensus. Attack on Titan? is a rather awesome anime. So many twists that kept me saying 'just one more episode. I'm pretty sure they're making another season (biggest cliffhangers at the end), which I can't wait for!
